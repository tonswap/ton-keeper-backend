### Ton Keeper backend

This server goal is to connect a user in dapp with his ton keeper wallet on his mobile phone based on this example [github](https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-connect/tree/main/server-example) 

### Note
It is our recommendation as a solution architect and developer not to use centralized infrstructures (such as this project) in the decentralized protocols but, the new specification ton-connect v2 [github](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk) will be using an open source backend that supports more than one dapp at a time.
